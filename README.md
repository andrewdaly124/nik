# 0. Getting Started

Ignore the why here, just follow these instructions to get all this code onto your computer:

1. Install `git` from https://git-scm.com/download/win
2. Open file explorer to the directory you want to have this code. for me, I keep mine in `C:\Users\andre\Documents\code`, but it's obviously up to you
3. from the command line, run this command: `git clone https://github.com/andrewdaly124/nik.git`. This should download this repo to your PC, in a folder called `nik`
4. Now open VSCode and go to `file -> Open Folder` and click the `nik` folder that was just added.
5. Done! Now you have the repository on your PC
